Parts and Code for a electronic BugleCallPlayer

Ya know how there are a million stupid apps that are so simple and the creator makes like a million bucks?  Well, this is the opposite of that.   This is a list of parts, assembly and code for a device that plays bugle calls. Intended as an aid for my son to learn the bugle calls by ear along with the sheet music for his Scout troop. It could also be used as a subtitute bugler.
